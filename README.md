# Used technologies / Frameworks
**javaScript / React.js**

React.js state handling model is ideal for single page applications, where components are selectively rendered on the same page

# Used 3rd Party Libraries
**I use the following 3rd party libraries in my project:**

**"react-color":** abstracts the task of color selection instead of creating indvidual reptitive buttons

**"react-component-export-image":** enables exporting of App's Grid component as a downloadable image in different formats

**"styled-components":** a general personal preference when writing React, and in this Project it was of immense help to dynamically render styles;
 saving my soul from a messy jungle of redundant conditional statements
