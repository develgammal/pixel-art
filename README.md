## Welcome to the Pixel Art Creator!

**Who doesn't love Pixel Art?** üé®
That's right‚Äîno one! Dive into the world of pixel art with this fun and easy-to-use tool.

You can choose your canvas size üìè, select your favorite colors üé®, erase any mistakes ‚úÇÔ∏è, and when you're satisfied with your masterpiece, download it in your desired format üñºÔ∏è.

## Technologies and Frameworks

**Grid Algorithm**

I had to write a low-level JS algorithm to handle grid logic in Grid.js since I couldn't find a lib that handles this kind of logic.

**JavaScript / React.js**

React.js is perfect for single-page applications like this one, where components are dynamically rendered, providing a smooth and responsive user experience.

## Third-Party Libraries

**This project utilizes the following third-party libraries:**

- **`react-color`:** Simplifies color selection by abstracting it into a user-friendly interface, saving you from creating repetitive buttons.

- **`react-component-export-image`:** Allows you to export your pixel art grid as a downloadable image in various formats.

- **`styled-components`:** My go-to choice for writing dynamic styles in React. In this project, it helped avoid a tangled mess of conditional statements by enabling clean and maintainable styling.
